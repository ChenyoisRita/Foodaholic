# Challenges & Victories

<!--
In software engineering things rarely go as planned: tools don’t work as we expect, deadlines aren’t met, debugging sessions run longer than we hoped for, and so forth.

What were some of the biggest challenges you found when developing your project? How did you overcome them?
-->
1. Deadlines aren’t met. There are so many deadlines in my other courses as well so I sometimes overlook the deadline of OOSE. To overcome this, I have to improve my study efficiency, put the OOSE in my first place and also, stay up to finish my homework.
2. Debugging sessions run longer than we hoped for. To solve this problem, I would spend much time on debugging, meanwhile, looking up related references. If I was stil stuck in it for a long time, I would ask my teammates of TA for help.

Instead of giving you the same result every time, it will give you the results you may want to use the most.
