# Revisiting the Project Proposal & Design

<!--
How did the Project Proposal & Design documents help you develop your project?

What changed in your project since you wrote the initial version of those documents?
-->
Initially, the Project Proposal & Design documents helps us clearly state objectives and expected outcome. Besides, It keeps us a managable timeline so that we can working on the projects before deadlines. What's more, The Project Proposal & Design documents also prevent us from “Scope Creep”. It prevents the scale of our project from growing until getting out of control.

Many thing has changed since out first version of these documents. We have add new features that is required by our project, removed trivial features that are not related to the core features, and modified features that is not well-defined or well-presented.For instance, we have deleted the payment features due to the complexity of security problems. 


# Challenges & Victories

<!--
In software engineering things rarely go as planned: tools don’t work as we expect, deadlines aren’t met, debugging sessions run longer than we hoped for, and so forth.

What were some of the biggest challenges you found when developing your project? How did you overcome them?
-->
1. Deadlines aren’t met. There are so many deadlines in my other courses as well so I sometimes overlook the deadline of OOSE. To overcome this, I have to improve my study efficiency, put the OOSE in my first place and also, stay up to finish my homework.
2. Debugging sessions run longer than we hoped for. To solve this problem, I would spend much time on debugging, meanwhile, looking up related references. If I was stil stuck in it for a long time, I would ask my teammates of TA for help.

# Experience with Tools

<!--
Which tools did you learn to like? Why?

Which tools did you learn to dislike? Why? And what other tools would you have replaced them with if you were to start all over again?
-->
I like Android Studio because its code prompts and search are very powerful and really smart. For example, a custom layout has a name called btn_click_grey.xml. If you're in eclipse, you have to type in the beginning of this name(i.e. btn) to prompt for the following. But in Android Studio, you only need to type any substring, for example, grey, and it will prompt you. Also, Android Studio will intelligently predict and give you the best hints/prompts. Instead of giving you the same result every time, it will give you the results you may want to use the most.

There is no tools I dislike so far.

# Iteration 7 & Beyond

<!--
Where would you take your project from here? What features would you add to make your application even more awesome? How would you prioritize that work?

Update the project board with tasks for a hypothetical Iteration 7.
-->

I would recommend our application to my friends who like socialization and always participate in events like party and session. In order to make my application even more awesome, I would add features: chat with friends who particpate in the same events and create chat group of the same events.</br>
First, I should design the UI of chatting window, and then implement the function of sending my messages to Heroku and getting friend's message data from heroku.
