## User Stories

As an orginizer, I want to create a party for my birthday celebration. I first sign up and log in to my account in Foodaholic, then create a party by selecting the time and place, food list, and the party themes that I prefer. A invitation code of the party is generated, and I can send it to my friends to invite them to join in. 

As a user, I want to join a party of my friends. By viewing Foodaholic, I can browse the upcoming events nearby, find my friends' event and join them. I can come up with my ideas about the activities in the party. I can also view other's ideas and vote for them, and the final decision is upon the organizer. In the app, I can hat and comment on the party, and when the party ends, we shall split the bill.
