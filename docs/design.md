## Tools Outside the Toolbox

<!-- For each tool: What is it? Why did you choose it? Where do you get it? How do you learn it? Follow the model of how we presented the tools in the Toolbox. Cute original drawings encouraged. -->
**1. Android Studio**
<br>Android studio is the official tool for developing application exclusively for Android platform. It has a strong editor tool for developing creative UI and emulators for different versions to test and simulate sensors without having actual Android devices. 
<br>We choose the Android Studio because we are going to develop an Android Application. The Android Studio could help a lot in accelerating our application development and building the highest-quality apps for each Android device. Also, it is based on IntelliJ IDEA, which is a familiar tool for us.
<br>In order to get Android Studio, we just need to launch the Android Studio DMG file, drag and drop Android Studio into the Applications folder, then launch Android Studio.
<br>To learn Android programming through Android Studio, we can follow the online tutorials or books. And then we should put what we learned into the practice in this project.

**2. JavaMail API**
<br>JavaMail is a Java API used to send and receive email via SMTP, POP3 and IMAP. And now it is available for Android. JavaMail API could provide us a platform-independent and protocol-independent framework to build mail and messaging framework. 
<br>We choose the JavaMail API because the organizer of an event depends on emails to invite his guests in our designed project. Also, JavaMail programming is based on Java programming language, which we are familiar with.
<br>In order to get JavaMail API, we can download and install the JavaMail API on its official website.
<br>We can learn how to use JavaMail API through following the online tutorials and guidance. Then we should combine the knowledge with our project in practice.

**3. OpenLayers API**
<br>OpenLayers is an open-source JavaScript library for displaying map data in web browsers as slippy maps. It provides an API for building rich web-based geographic applications similar to Google Maps and Bing Maps. It's similar to Google Maps API.
<br>We choose the OpenLayers API because users of our application depend on the dynamic maps to get the location of events, meanwhile, the events could be sorted by distance which the maps could display. 
And OpenLayers makes it easy to put a dynamic map in any web page. It can display map tiles, vector data and markers loaded from any source. It will greatly help us in connecting the dynamic maps with our application. Also, it is free to download and use!
<br>In order to get the OpenLayers API, we can download OpenLayers API in its official website.
<br>We can learn how to use OpenLayers API by following corresponding online tutorials and teaching videos.

**4. Google Calendar API**
<br>The Google Calendar API lets users perform most of the operations a normal Google Calendar user can on the Google Calendar website. Google Calendar allows client applications to view and update calendar events in the form of Google data API, GData, feeds. Google Calendar allows us to manage events, meetings, holidays, and anything else we need to schedule. 
<br>We choose the Google Calendar API because in our proposal, users could add the upcoming events to their own calendar, which helps them schedule the events. Interacting with Google Calendar is required. Also, Google calendar is one of the most popular calendars in the world, and there are many related open sources we could make use of.
<br>In order to get Google Calendar API, We must first have a Google Calendar API Key and then include the google-calendar plugin. And then we could start writing code to initialize the calendar in JavaScript.
<br>We can learn how to get started with the Google Calendar API by following the online guidance and related tutorials.
