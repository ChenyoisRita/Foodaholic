A general event planner.



To the iteration 4 grader: 

The application consists of two parts, the server and the mobile app. In this iteration, **the commits are in the server branch**. The server branch is on https://foodaholic-server.herokuapp.com/ (a nearly blank admin page, serving as the domain of this project) In this branch, we updated the server branch, postman and Junit test in the server side. Due to lack of time, it is virtually impossible for us to link mobile app and server at this time - it is going to be implemented with pack retrofit. With full respect, we have to say that we are shocked by being given the iteration instruction before 2 days of a iteration deadline, which nearly knock us back to iteration 1. However, the suggestion itself of implementing the server is very beneficial to us - we just need these advices some time earlier.
